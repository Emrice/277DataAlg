//  This assignment is an enhancement of the example provided in the textbook for linking airports.  Assume the user provides you with the following 2 items of information for as many different airports as they desire:
//  1.  Standard 3 character airport code ///   2.  Distance from New York City's LaGuardia
//  Airport to the specified airport, in miles.
//  The head of the list should be represented with an element whose value is 'LGA' and whose distance is 0.
//  Airport codes will be provided in order of closest to furthest away.
//  Create a singly linked list to house each of the airports as a node in the same order in which it was provided (nearest to furthest).
//  Each node should contain both the airport code and the entered distance.
//  Once the list is built, develop an additional function which allows the user to search for a user-specified code and then output all other codes and distances which follow it in the list.
//
//  Test Data: 1 JFK 5 1 TBR 21 1 NWK 28 1 AWK 32 2 JFK 2 TBR 2 NWK 2 AWK 2 lol 2 random 3 4
